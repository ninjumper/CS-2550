        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I like to make Youtube videos of me and my friends playing video games together.
            My friends and I liked watching other people on Youtube who already made a successful career
             doing the same thing. I thought my friends and I are very entertaining and always wished there was a way
             to go back and watch some of the best moments.<br>
             I work for a mechanical bull company. I essentially bring it in a van and set it up at an event and I party with
              the guests until I need to take it down and bring it back. It is a very fun job. I heard of this job because
              one of the owners is friends with my sister. <br>
              I also love to dance. I can boogie too pretty much anything and I've been trying to get better at country swing
               dancing specifically. I owe one of my best friends for making me go the first time and it was a blast.
